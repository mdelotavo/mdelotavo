### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Software Engineer working in DevOps. Most of my GitHub projects are private, but I actively maintain a few public Apigee projects that I worked on during my time at [**Darumatic**](https://github.com/darumatic). Additionally, I have forks of those projects as well. I plan to clean up those projects and make necessary changes to support existing clients before eventually deprecating and archiving them. Please refer to [**Darumatic's**](https://github.com/darumatic) GitHub page to see more of their projects. By searching for "apigee" on their page, you should find some of my projects.
